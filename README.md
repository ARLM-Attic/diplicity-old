diplicity
=========

Next generation Droidippy.

## Ideas

* Mobile first
* Full offline mode for reading data
 * Likely no creating of data while offline, and automatic sync when offline, but it would be nice
* One interface for iPhone, Android and web

## Running locally

Check out the code:

```
git clone git@github.com:zond/diplicity.git
```

Download [the Google App Engine SDK](https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads) and unpack it somewhere.

Run the development app server:

```

```
